# Security Policy

This project handles riggers and cable splicers job-site coordination
workflows. Treat vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when
the demo data is synthetic — this occupation prepares loads for
crane/hoist lifting and splices/inspects wire rope under a load and
cable-failure risk profile.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real client, crew or operator data exposure
- authorization bypass
- RiggerCoordGovernor bypass
- op-allowlist widening toward load-rigging/lift-readiness certification or site-safety-judgment override
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- unsafe robot action dispatch

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on client/crew data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real client/crew/operator data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
